Please note that Raspberry Pi Zero is insufficient to run both the Home Assistant and Music Cards concurrently. I recommend you use a Raspberry Pi 3 if you intend to run both at the same time.

## Steps to Configure and/or Run once if you dont want Music Cards to AutoStart

1. Run `python config.py` to select the reader from the inputs
2. Run `python add_card.py` to scan cards and enter your Google Play Music Playlist Name
3. Run `python box.py` to start the application and verify that it is reading your cards and csv list properly

## Install Service to AutoStart

- Change directory to music-cards/
```bash
cd music-cards/
```
- Copy the musiccards.service file to systemd
```bash
sudo cp musiccards.service /etc/systemd/system/musiccards.service
```
- Reload the Daemon
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
- Start the musiccards.service
```bash
sudo systemctl start musiccards.service
```
- Check if musiccards.service is running
```bash
sudo systemctl status musiccards.service
```

## HomeAssistant Setup for Google Music

1. Place the files under homeassistant_files in the config directory of your [Homeassistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) machine.
2. You will need to create custom_components/switch directory in your config directory and place [`gmusic.py`](https://github.com/mf-social/Home-Assistant/blob/master/custom_components/switch/gmusic.py) in there.
3. Follow [this forum post](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/google-music-in-ha/10976) to install gmusicapi, find your device id, and set up the component.
